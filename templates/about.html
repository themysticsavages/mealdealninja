        MEAL DEAL NINJA is about making nuritional, affordable recipes for those who struggle with <b> FOOD INSECURITY</b>. We focus 
        on recipes that can range from vegan, dairy free, and gluten free. The range of recipes also provide the amount of calories the meal is. Our main 
        motivation to create a program was due to the inaccessiable food options for those who can not afford to a sustainable food plan. 
        Food insercurity is a serious health issue that is not commonly talked about in the media. We hope to raise 
        awareness to this health issue and help people overcome their inaccessiability to healthy and nuritional food.
